## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> My name is Dean Rahman. I came to University of Helsinki from New York city (originally I'm from Detroit). I am interested in applying machine learning to language technology (for example machine translation) and trading US Futures. Previously I have done work in Data Visualization, Product Development, Supply Chain, Sourcing & Procurement, Corporate Strategy, Operational Finance and Organizational Change Management in the Technology, Automotive, Oil & Gas and Medical Device industries. My favorite activities outside work are learning languages with my wife Elina and swimming with my son Kaleb and daughter Aurora.
