## Introduction

<img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/I_THXnIoxNg/0.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> My name is Dean Rahman. In fall of 2019 (period II), I studied the course titled "Command Line Tools for Linguists" at University of Helsinki. It was taught by fantastic lecturers [Hande Celikkanat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hande-celikkanat-08664423/) and [Miikka Silfverberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miikka-silfverberg-78146019). Here is the [description of the course](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/kik-lg219/129824412) by the course organizers. Below is a summary of my experience with the course which I have a written as a part of the final project for the course.

Like all 5-credit single-period courses at U of Hel (which constitute the great majority of courses here), the Command Line course was 7 weeks of action-packed compressed learning fun, each week with a new module of concepts. Hence the week by week structure of the summary. (The redundant numbering with each of the week numbers is to highlight the use of a markdown list discussed in week 7 :) Enjoy!            

1. Week 1

   Introduction to Command Line Environments

   We familiarized ourselves with Command Line Environments. Even though the majority of us had already gotten at least a peak at command line environments before (e.g. in the prerequisite course Introduction to Linguistics), this is the spot for me to express what each of us felt the first time we really comprehended what command lines were about: Holy Cow! We were culture shocked and delighted at the simultaneous self-service orientation and simplicity of  command lines after growing up with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as Windows, Macs and smartphones. The most clich√© but effective explanation to a newbie is something along the lines of..imagine, instead of clicking an highlighting a file icon inside a folder and dragging it into another folder, you type in a highly specific sentence to the computer so it does the same thing. (This is of course because the folders thing is a just an analogy for our human brains for the construct that computers use in an array of memory..blah blah blah..). As you will see if you read the rest of the course summary, moving a file is the tip of the visible tip of the hidden iceberg, but for this week, it's enough to say the other simple things we learned which were mind blowing.

   Typing in the simple two character command <ls> (abbreviation for list), lists out all the visible files and folders in a folder (called "directory" in non-iconic speak). You can move out of a directory (folder) to go one folder up by typing <cd ..>. Using some pre-specified few characters or the folder path allows you to see the list of files in any directory or change to any directory (e.g. cd ~/KIK-LG219/final/). <wget https//somewebsite.com/somefile.jpg> lets you download a file from a website without opening up a GUI browser. Holy cow! One of the students remembers a reference to this in either the movie The Social Network or the show Silicone Valley, both about programmers.  

2. Week 2

   Navigating a UNIX System

   Stuff we were doing in Week 1 to files (copying, moving, deleting), we started doing to entire directories in Week 2! We also learned how to move files *between* computers. Holy guocamole! (The other computer, not the one you're physically typing on, being called a "remote server" through a remote connection command named <scp>). In the context of zipping and unzipping files. 

    

3. Week 3

   Basic Corpus Processing

4. Week 4

   Advanced Corpus Processing
   It was really good to get two weeks of continuity on corpus process, because, you know, LANGUAGE technology :)

5. Week 5

   Scripting and Configuration Files

6. Week 6

   Installing and Running Programs

7. Week 7

   Version control on github  
   Markdown files (simple text files with links to websites, references to pictures and some cool text-based tricks such as tables and lists) and building static webpages thereof using Jeckyll. Hosting on github.io

+ Final Project

Webpage introducing myself created from a markdown file.
A similarly created webpage introducing this course. (You are in fact looking at this very page).
A webpage created in Latex using Overleaf of my CV.

+ A Summary of the Summary

Table
Week#	| Theme	| Example

+ Concluding thoughts, must have a table (done), picture (placeholder in) and a list (??) somewhere

Operate in a linux environment. Process corpora..and hilarious comics about every new week's topic
